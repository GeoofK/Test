    <h1>Hi There!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website. This is my first website to develop. Here are some of the things i've learned,</p><br>
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    <p>we use h1 - h6 elements to write headings on a website. H1 has most importance and H6 being the list important.</p>
    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>To write a paragraph, we use the P element where all the content is written in between the P element.</p>
    <h4>images</h4>
    <p>To put an image in a website we use the img element which contains attributes inside it.<br> Below are some of the attributes;<br>
    <ul>
        <li>src - gives the location of the image</li>
        <li>alt - used as a failsafe inacase the image fails to display</li>
        <li>widht, height - used to style the image</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Lets display an image,</p><hr>
    <img src="jeffita.jpg" alt="picture" width="70%">
    <h5>Tables</h5>
    <p>lets jump into tables. Tables organize content in a rows and columns format. Start of by creating a table element. inside the element input table row element followed 
        by table header. this will be the first row/ header in the table. Input another tr and indent td to fill in the data.<br>Lets make a student table with name, cousre and age as rows. This will turn out into a table as follows;</p>
        <table border="2">
            <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>cousre</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>John</td>
                <td>BISF</td>
                <td>23</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Grace</td>
                <td>BIT</td>
                <td>19</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mike</td>
                <td>BBIT</td>
                <td>21</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
